# UNP-PROJECT_WITH-MYSQL_ADVENTURE-WORKS
Completed this project as a part of my SQL internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP)

AdventureWorks is a sample database used for learning and demonstrating data analysis techniques. This project involved setting up a database to manage Customers,Product_categories,Product _subcategories,Products,Sales ,Territories tables. We ensured data integrity by defining constraints on the columns within each table. Finally, we wrote SQL queries specifically for all the tables to manage and analyze data
